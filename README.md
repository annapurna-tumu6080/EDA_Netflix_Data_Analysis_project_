# EDA_Netflix_Data_Analysis_project_
A Netflix dataset was analyzed to explore content trends, genres, country-wise distribution, and release patterns. After cleaning and visualizing the data, key insights were identified, including growing TV show production and popular genres. The project strengthened my EDA and visualization skills.
