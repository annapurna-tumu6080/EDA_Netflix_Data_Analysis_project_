# EDA_Netflix_Data_Analysis_project_
A Netflix dataset was analyzed to explore content trends, genres, country-wise distribution, and release patterns. After cleaning and visualizing the data, key insights were identified, including growing TV show production and popular genres. The project strengthened my EDA and visualization skills.

The Netflix Data Analysis project is a hands-on exploration of one of the world’s largest entertainment platforms. In this project, my main goal was to understand how Netflix organizes its global content and what factors influence the type of movies and shows people watch. Instead of just working with numbers, I focused on discovering meaningful insights that explain user preferences, content patterns, and trends in the streaming industry.

I began by cleaning the Netflix dataset, which included titles, genres, release years, countries, ratings, cast, and descriptions. This step helped remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize important fields. After preparing the data, I explored how content has evolved over the years. One interesting observation was that Netflix has been releasing significantly more TV shows in recent years, showing a clear shift in their content strategy.

Next, I analyzed genres to see what users tend to watch the most. Drama, Comedy, and International shows stood out as top-performing categories, reflecting Netflix’s global audience. I also examined how content varies by country—for example, India contributes a large number of movies, while the U.S. dominates in TV shows. This helped highlight Netflix’s diverse production network.

I used various data-visualization tools to convert these insights into interactive charts and dashboards. Features like heatmaps, bar charts, and time-series plots helped make the findings easy to understand. I also built a simple recommendation approach based on genre similarity, giving users suggestions that matched their preferences.

Overall, this project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, storytelling, and Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. More importantly, it helped me learn how to transform raw data into real-world insights about customer behavior and content performance.
